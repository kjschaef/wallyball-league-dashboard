{"response":"### Short answer\n- Best by all-time win %: **Parker — 63.54% (96 games, career)**.  \n- Best overall (reliability + impact): **Nate — 57.92% (644 games, career)** and **currently leading this season: 65.22% (115 games)**.\n\n### Why\n- **Parker**: highest career win rate but **hasn’t played this season (0 games)** — small/isolated sample and no current form.  \n- **Nate**: very large sample (644 career games), long-term consistency, active now with a strong current-season rate and ongoing streak — indicates both skill and reliability.  \n- **Hodnett** and **Lance** are also strong but below Nate in sustained impact.\n\n### Practical takeaway\n- If you need the safest pick for lineup/strategy or scouting, choose **Nate** (best combination of sample size and current form).  \n- Treat **Parker** as a high-upside player if he returns — verify current fitness/form first.  \n- When facing **Nate**, pressure his serve-receive, shorten rallies, and exploit weak rotations; when evaluating Parker, get recent footage before adjusting tactics.","type":"performance_analysis","timestamp":"2025-11-26T01:09:17.754Z","playerCount":24,"additionalData":{"usedRules":false}}
