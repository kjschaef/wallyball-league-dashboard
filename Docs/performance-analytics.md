# Performance Analytics

## Overview

The Performance Analytics feature provides comprehensive data visualization and analysis tools for tracking player and team performance over time. It enables users to identify trends, compare performance metrics, and gain deep insights into volleyball match outcomes through multiple visualization types and analytical approaches.

## Key Features

1. **Performance Trend Visualization**
   - Win percentage trends over time
   - Total wins tracking 
   - Weekly or cumulative data views
   - Inactivity penalty visualization

2. **Player Performance Radar**
   - Multi-dimensional player comparison
   - Customizable performance metrics
   - Interactive radar chart visualization
   - Up to 3-player simultaneous comparison

3. **Head-to-Head Analysis**
   - Compare two players' performances when playing together vs. against each other
   - Win/loss records for different player combinations
   - Win rate calculations for different team compositions

4. **Advanced Performance Metrics**
   - Win Rate (with inactivity penalty)
   - Consistency (streak analysis)
   - Improvement (recent vs. historical performance)
   - Play Volume (participation frequency)

5. **Export Capabilities**
   - Dashboard export as image
   - Performance chart sharing

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Radar Component

The PlayerPerformanceRadar component allows multi-dimensional comparison of players across several key performance metrics:

```typescript
export function PlayerPerformanceRadar() {
  const [selectedPlayers, setSelectedPlayers] = useState<number[]>([]);
  const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState<string[]>(performanceMetrics.map(m => m.name));
  const [expandedView, setExpandedView] = useState(false);
  
  // Prepare data for the radar chart
  const radarData = metrics.map(metricName => {
    const metric = performanceMetrics.find(m => m.name === metricName);
    if (!metric) return null;
    
    const dataPoint: Record<string, any> = { 
      metric: metric.displayName,
      fullMark: 100,
    };
    
    players
      .filter(player => selectedPlayers.includes(player.id))
      .forEach(player => {
        const value = metric.calculate(player, players);
        dataPoint[player.name] = value;
      });
    
    return dataPoint;
  }).filter(Boolean);
  
  // Component rendering with RadarChart from recharts
}
```

### Performance Metrics Implementation

The application calculates several advanced metrics for player performance:

```typescript
const performanceMetrics: PerformanceMetric[] = [
  {
    name: "winRate",
    displayName: "Win Rate",
    description: "Percentage of games won, adjusted for inactivity",
    calculate: (player) => {
      const { penalizedWinRate } = calculatePenalizedWinPercentage(player);
      return penalizedWinRate;
    },
    scale: [0, 100],
  },
  {
    name: "consistency",
    displayName: "Consistency",
    description: "Measure of how consistently a player performs across games",
    calculate: (player) => {
      // Streak analysis calculation
      // Higher score = fewer changes between winning and losing
    },
    scale: [0, 100],
  },
  {
    name: "improvement",
    displayName: "Improvement",
    description: "How much a player has improved recently compared to their historical performance",
    calculate: (player) => {
      // Compare recent performance to historical performance
      // Map to 0-100 scale: 0 = decline, 50 = neutral, 100 = improvement
    },
    scale: [0, 100],
  },
  {
    name: "volume",
    displayName: "Play Volume",
    description: "How frequently a player participates in games relative to other players",
    calculate: (player, allPlayers) => {
      // Calculate normalized score based on match participation
    },
    scale: [0, 100],
  },
];
```

### Head-to-Head Analysis

The AdvancedPlayerDashboard component includes detailed head-to-head analysis:

```typescript
// Calculate head-to-head statistics between two players
const getHeadToHeadStats = () => {
  if (!selectedPlayerId || !comparisonPlayerId) return null;
  
  const player1 = players.find(p => p.id === selectedPlayerId);
  const player2 = players.find(p => p.id === comparisonPlayerId);
  
  // Find matches where both players participated
  const relevantMatches = player1.matches.filter(match1 => {
    return player2.matches.some(match2 => match2.id === match1.id);
  });
  
  // Calculate statistics for when they played on same team vs. opposite teams
  // Return win rates, win-loss records, and other metrics
};
```

### Inactivity Penalty System

Performance analytics incorporates inactivity penalties to provide a more accurate representation of player performance:

```typescript
// Calculate inactivity penalty:
const daysSinceLastActivity = Math.floor(
  (currentDate.getTime() - lastActivityDate.getTime()) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
);

// No penalty for first 2 weeks
const gracePeriodDays = 14;
const excessInactiveDays = Math.max(0, daysSinceLastActivity - gracePeriodDays);

// Calculate weeks inactive beyond grace period (5% per week)
const weeksInactive = Math.floor(excessInactiveDays / 7);
const penaltyPerWeek = 0.05; // 5% per week
const maxPenalty = 0.5; // 50% maximum penalty

// Calculate penalty gradually
const inactivityPenalty = Math.min(maxPenalty, weeksInactive * penaltyPerWeek);
const decayFactor = 1 - inactivityPenalty;

// Apply penalty to metrics
processedDataPoint[player.name] = lastValue * decayFactor;
```

### Dashboard Share Feature

The dashboard sharing feature uses html2canvas to capture the dashboard content as an image:

```typescript
const shareAsImage = async () => {
  let originalWidth = '';
  try {
    setIsExporting(true);
    const element = document.getElementById('analytics-content');
    if (!element) return;

    // Save original width and get computed height
    originalWidth = element.style.width;
    const height = element.getBoundingClientRect().height;

    // Set export width
    element.style.width = '1200px';
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));

    const canvas = await html2canvas(element, {
      backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
      scale: 2,
      width: 1200,
      height: Math.ceil(height),
      // Additional options...
    });

    // Download the image
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating image:', error);
  } finally {
    // Restore original styling
    // ...
    setIsExporting(false);
  }
};
```

## Data Visualization Components
