# Seasonal System Design Document

## Executive Summary

The Wallyball League Dashboard has reached a scale where regular players face significant challenges in improving their statistics due to the large volume of historical games. This design document outlines a comprehensive seasonal system that will segment data into quarterly periods, enabling fresh starts and maintaining engagement for regular players.

## Problem Analysis

### Current Challenges
- **Statistical Stagnation**: Players like Hodnett (489 games) and Nate (434 games) find it nearly impossible to meaningfully improve their win percentages
- **Achievement Fatigue**: With 215+ matches in the system, achievements become increasingly difficult to unlock
- **Lack of Fresh Competition**: No reset mechanism creates static rankings that discourage participation
- **Historical Weight**: New players can't compete effectively against established statistics

### Data Analysis
- Total matches: 215
- Game volume range: 15-489 games per player
- Top players have 8-week activity streaks but face diminishing returns on stats
- Achievement system becomes harder to progress as game counts increase

## Solution: Quarterly Seasonal System

### Season Definition
- **Q1**: January 1 - March 31
- **Q2**: April 1 - June 30  
- **Q3**: July 1 - September 30
- **Q4**: October 1 - December 31

### Data Architecture

#### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- New seasons table
CREATE TABLE seasons (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- "2025 Q1", "2025 Q2", etc.
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add season_id to matches table
ALTER TABLE matches ADD COLUMN season_id INTEGER REFERENCES seasons(id);

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_season_id ON matches(season_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_matches_season_date ON matches(season_id, date);

-- Seasonal achievements table
CREATE TABLE seasonal_achievements (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  season_id INTEGER REFERENCES seasons(id),
  player_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(id),
  achievement_id INTEGER REFERENCES achievements(id),
  unlocked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(season_id, player_id, achievement_id)
);
```

#### API Layer Modifications

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/seasons` - List all seasons
- `GET /api/seasons/current` - Get current active season
- `GET /api/player-stats?season={id|current|lifetime}` - Seasonally-filtered stats
- `GET /api/matches?season={id|current|lifetime}` - Season-specific matches
- `GET /api/achievements/seasonal?season={id}&player={id}` - Seasonal achievements

**Updated Endpoints:**
- All existing stats endpoints accept optional `season` parameter
- Default behavior remains lifetime stats for backward compatibility

### User Interface Design

#### Dashboard Page Enhancements

**Season Selector Component:**
```jsx
// Position: Top of dashboard, below main heading
<SeasonSelector 
  currentSeason="2025 Q3"
  seasons={["2025 Q3", "2025 Q2", "2025 Q1", "Lifetime"]}
  selectedSeason={selectedSeason}
  onChange={setSelectedSeason}
/>
```

**Visual Treatment:**
- Prominent toggle buttons: "Current Season | Lifetime Stats"
- Dropdown for historical seasons
- Clear visual indicator of which view is active
- Season context displayed in all stat components

#### Results Page Modifications

INSERT INTO seasons (name, start_date, end_date, is_active) VALUES
  ('2025 Q1', '2025-01-01', '2025-03-31', false),
  ('2025 Q2', '2025-04-01', '2025-06-30', false),
  ('2025 Q3', '2025-07-01', '2025-09-30', true);

-- Assign existing matches to seasons
UPDATE matches SET season_id = (
  SELECT id FROM seasons 
  WHERE matches.date >= seasons.start_date 
  AND matches.date <= seasons.end_date
  LIMIT 1
);
```
